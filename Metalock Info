# X BUTTON

Ultra powerfull shot that goes to the direction your looking (You can litterally do full field goals) btw it has gravity still so it wont go where your looking at for forever. Has kaiser impact animation and blue godspeed particles

# T BUTTON

Steal the ball from anywhere... Yes litterally anywhere, The ball has zero reset turn animations and copycat particles

# G BUTTON

You will run with special particles that makes it look like its a spec, you run really fast but its not that insanely fast. Its litterally perfect amount, you can controll it perfectlt and ur fast

# Z BUTTON

Toggle extra weapon mode

# Q BUTTON

Switch weapons, you cant switch and use all weapons tho, Lets say ur in 2v2, your teammate has Direct shot, your enemies has Wild Card and Pka. You can switch between direct shot, wild card and pka. However i blacklisted some weapons such as reflex, powershot, web, Ninja, Planet Hotline, Snake (Sorry snake users i made this script for myself and i dont use snake 🙏) Since they all are trash.

# B BUTTON

Throw the ball wait a little then press B, the script will get the ball like chigiri. instant teleport to the ball when ball touches the ground with loki anims and particles

# Action Buttons

1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 are action buttons, when extra weapon mode is on you can use moves by those action buttons

# Cooldowns

You still have the cooldowns... However there are some moves that have 0 cooldown and you can spam them

- Wild Counter
- Zombie dribbling scissors (Op asf)
- BBD (You cant shoot the ball it just does animations, particles and sounds. Others can hear the sounds aswell and this has no stun you can litterally spam this as many as you want)
- ZD stealing dashes (Only dash vfx, Doesnt steals the ball)

# Things you need to know / Bugs

**Freezing the game** : Using perfect pass from genius makes the ball untouchable... Litterally even with script you cant get it

**Curves** : You cant do any curve moves like pka curves or genius curves

**Double Trap** : If you have 2 or more control users in your game you can double trap by clicking once (Your traps stacks, you do one and then another... Its so op, funny and usefull)

**Inf Ginga / Rage** : If you use rage or ginga and the person that has that move leaves you can have the boost for infinite amount of time (Since you use move from them)

**Double Cooldown** : When you use any moves that gets you cooldown eventually the person that has that move gets the cooldown too, not just you... So this is litterally copycat %100 and you make your oppodent have cooldown lol

**Unuseable Move** : This just happend to me once since it happens rarely but if your enemy used an move and when its on cooldown you cant use that move (Not confirmed idk)

**Hand Ball** : If you use direct shot from someone and the user that has direct shot leaves the ball will be with your hands, you can use fly command from inf yield and litterally score inf goals, also you can kick or use moves on the ball so you can make it look like it has particles lol
